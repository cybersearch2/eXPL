	 * The second unifies "customer" axiom with "customer_freight" template.
	 * Unlike the first version, this sample declares the names of the axiom terms so they can be matched to template terms by name.
	 * The customer_freight template also explicitly assigns a value to it's "charge" term, rather than relying on unification to do the trick.
