 6. Add duplicateOperandCheck() method to OperandMap
 7. Introduce inner Template and '<<' operator to for Calculator query. 
 8. Add 'isInnerTemplate' flag to Template to provid a way to signal added terms should not be added to the OperandMap

10, Add AxiomOperand to support AxiomList assignment and concatenation
10. Enhance VariableType to return AxiomOperand instance for AXIOM OperandType

14. Add AxiomUtils for deep copy of Axioms and axiom Terms
15. Enhance QueryLauncher by allowing passing of arguments from QueryParams to Calculator execution calls
16. Add initialization of axioms to Calculator and return of solution from Template as AxiomList
17. Change Scope.getTemplate() so it looks first in global scope
18. Change ScopeContext and OperandMap so only lists which are empty at the start are cleared on reset.
19. Change OperandMap to remove addition of new item list variable to OperandMap.
20. Update syntax to remove 'calc' keyword from query declaration. 
21. Update ParserAssembler and Template to use new 'isCalculator" flag
22. ParserAssembler addScopeAxiom() and getAxiomTermNameList() now look first in global scope for axiomTermNameList
23. Refactor active part of ParameterOperand to dependency ParameterList and share it with new AxiomParameterOperand
24. Make return type of CallEvaluator generic and make associated classes generic to suit
25. Apply interface Concaten<String> to Operands which may have StringOperand delegates
26. Set Structure termList to empty list in constructor and update all empty list tests
27. Automatically insert LogicQuery as head query when a calculator is at the head and an axiom key specified
28. Dynamically populate automatically inserted Template and get Calculator to look for axiom in Solution
29. QueryLauncher now uses axiomKey only for choice Template
30. Replace QueryParams Axiom passing design to use a Solution object and clear Scope Axioms on ScopeContext reset()
31. Fixed issue with Evaluator clearValue() which was not invoking operand backup to permit another calculation
32. Added id to interface ItemList newVariableInstance() so list variable id can be set for AxiomTermList item in AxiomList
33. Bind a dynamic AxiomListVariable to to a Variable operand instead of an AxiomOperand
34. Add concatenation to DelegateOperand, with AxiomList a special case from standard String concatenation.
35. Add clearValue() override to DelegateOperand which visits child operand tree and forces backup
36. AxiomParameterOperand updated to specify axiom name separately from operand name
37. Do not add terms with qualified names to Axiom from Template conversion
38. Fix compiler TemplateExpression and AxiomList productions
39. CurrencyOperand to refresh it's country locale in formatValue() in case it has changed since last evaluation
40. Fix Variable not updating delegate class after evaluation
41. Create static AssignOnlyOperator delegate for DelegateOperator
42. Allow unnamed parameters to be used in query call
43. Add Calculator queries in same scope. Template push() and pop() saves and restores call context.
44. A Calculator query can now reference a query or a Calculator, with query having precedence
45. ParserAssembler changes to reference AxiomLists in variables completed
46. Support single dimension AxiomList variable access. See insert sort for example.
47. Copy term names list when concatenating to an empty AxiomLIst
48. Update AxiomUtils.marshallAxiomTerms() to copy each term value to Parameter to make it immutable
49. ParserAssembler getQueryOperand() method split off from getCallOperand() as function and query invocations are now different
50. Allow an AxiomTermList object to be assigned to an AxiomListVariable object
51. Add AxiomListListener interface to AxiomOperand to add AxiomLists to query results
52. Prevent literal value assignment being converted to simply a literal operand
53. Fix AxiomParameterOperand id not being updated on evaluation
54. Add Unknown helper class and replace complilier NULL literal with UNKNOWN literal.
55. Change QueryParams properties to parameters - Axioms mapped to template qualified names
56. New OperandParam helper class is now used to pass parameters to calls.
57. Compilier now collects call parameters and axiom terms into lists containing OperandParam objects
58. Applicable Operand classes updated to to use OperandParam objects
59. Add inner Choice which uses local variables
